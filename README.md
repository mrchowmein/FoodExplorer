# FoodExplorer
Food Explorer is an Android app built with an retrained Tensorflow classifier that allows it to recognize 24 different Japanese food dishes.  From sashimi to takoyaki, just launch the app, point your phone camera at the food.  Using the trained classifier, the app will attempt to identify the food.
